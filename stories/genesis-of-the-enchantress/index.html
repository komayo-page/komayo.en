        <h2>Preamble</h2>

        <p itemprop="description">
          In Edo period Japan, where shadows dance with lantern light and stories are whispered in the darkness of moonless nights, an ancestral ritual takes place: the Hyakumonogatari Kaidankai. This ceremony of one hundred ghost stories, a centuries-old tradition, invites participants to share their most troubling tales while extinguishing, one by one, the hundred andons that illuminate the room.
        </p>

        <p>
          On this night, in a traditional house with rice paper walls, a group has gathered to perpetuate this tradition. The lanterns cast their flickering lights on attentive faces, creating a ballet of shadows that seem to dance to the rhythm of the participants' heartbeats.
        </p>

        <p>
          As the eighty-fourth andon continues to burn peacefully, a woman takes the floor. Her name is Mayoko, and she is about to share a tale that dates back to the Kamakura era. A story that begins with a simple game, born in a remote village, and finds its conclusion in the court of a powerful gokenin.
        </p>

        <p>
          In the growing darkness of the room, as incense burns slowly and shadows lengthen, the assembly holds its breath. For in this Japan where yokai prowl in the darkness and magic permeates every corner of existence, the simplest stories can hide the deepest secrets.
        </p>

        <p>
          And tonight, as the eighty-fourth flame flickers gently, a voice rises to tell a story that crosses ages, a story of passion, honor, and destiny.
        </p>
