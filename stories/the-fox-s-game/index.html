        <h2>Preamble</h2>

        <p itemprop="description">
          In feudal Japan, where social conventions reign supreme, loneliness can become a prison more oppressive than the thickest walls. For Yuki, a young noblewoman, days flow with the regularity of an hourglass in her luxurious Kyōto residence, each grain representing another moment of isolation.
        </p>

        <p>
          The arrival of a mysterious strategy game, a gift from her absent husband, will change her existence. What begins as a simple pastime quickly becomes a consuming obsession, transforming her nights into a theater of shadows where reality and imagination merge.
        </p>

        <p>
          When her husband finally returns, he discovers an unrecognizable woman, prisoner of a spiral whose rules she alone seems to know. His quest to save her will lead him to the heart of an enigma where ancestral traditions and unspoken desires mingle, revealing that some games, once started, can no longer be stopped.
        </p>

        <p>
          A captivating story about the fine line between passion and obsession, and about the dangers that await us when we seek to escape our solitude at any cost.
        </p>
