        <h2>Preamble</h2>

        <p itemprop="description">
          There are stories we hesitate to share, not for fear of judgment, but because they change us so profoundly that we struggle to recognize who we were before. Yoshirō's testimony is one of these.
        </p>

        <p>
          At forty-two, he led an uneventful life in the offices of Osaka. A stable job, a functional apartment, a well-oiled routine - the kind of existence that doesn't make waves. Some call it wisdom, others resignation.
        </p>

        <p>
          But one September evening, weary of overtime and mounting files, he accepts a colleague's invitation. A trivial decision, almost insignificant. After all, the Regency Bar is just one establishment among many, nestled in the city's bustling streets.
        </p>

        <p>
          What happened there that night, Yoshirō tells us in his own words. His story is that of a man who discovers, sometimes painfully, that life can still surprise us when we thought we had seen it all.
        </p>

              We headed toward the elevator, our footsteps echoing in the empty corridor.

              The air was cooler there.

            <p>
              Hiro kept talking about Akiko and the bar.
              A subtle perfume lingered in the air, blending floral and woody notes.
              I discreetly breathed in, appreciating this feminine trail that awakened my curiosity.
