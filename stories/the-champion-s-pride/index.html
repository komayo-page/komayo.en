        <h2>Preamble</h2>

        <p itemprop="description">
          In the muffled silence of a nocturnal Shinkansen, Takeshi, the undisputed champion of ōgi, accepts a mysterious stranger's proposal for a friendly game. Draped in a kimono with cerulean reflections, she deploys a game as fascinating as it is unusual, initiating a confrontation that quickly transcends the traditional boundaries of the board.
        </p>

        <p>
          As the train cuts through the darkness towards Tokyo, what was meant to be just a distraction transforms into a trial where the champion's pride becomes his most formidable adversary. On this night when certainties waver, Takeshi is yet unaware that this chance encounter will forever mark his existence.
        </p>
