        <h2>Synopsis</h2>

        <p itemprop="abstract">A mystic nymph and a young idealist meet in a garden.
        He thinks he's seeking her, she has already chosen him.
        She wants to capture his soul, he desires to win her heart.
        He proposes a game of ōgi, she invites him to the beyond.
        In this game where eternal and ephemeral intertwine, destiny and design dance the final figure.</p>

        <h2>Preamble</h2>

        <p itemprop="description">There are places where the boundaries between our world and that of dreams fade, mystical sanctuaries where time itself hesitates to flow. It is in one of these realms that Komayō reigns, a goddess whose beauty is matched only by the millennial solitude that inhabits her.</p>

        <p>Her domain is an artificial paradise where perfection hides a darker truth. The souls that stray here find an enchanting refuge, unaware of the price they will have to pay for this eternal bliss. For Komayō seeks not their suffering, but their absolute devotion, feeding on their adoration like precious nectar that fuels her immortality.</p>

        <p>In her garden where cherry trees bloom eternally, she waits, patient as only immortals can be. Each new soul that crosses the threshold of her realm is a promise, a hope to fill the void that has grown within her for centuries.</p>

        <p>On this particular day, as the veil between worlds thins, Komayō perceives the approach of a different soul. A presence that could perhaps, for the first time in millennia, shake the very foundations of her existence. She prepares to welcome this unexpected visitor, yet unaware that this encounter could forever transform the very nature of her dream realm.</p>

        <p>This is the story of a goddess who has forgotten what true love was, and of a mortal whose dreams transcend reality itself. It is a tale where desire and sacrifice mingle, where eternity itself might have too high a price to pay.</p>
